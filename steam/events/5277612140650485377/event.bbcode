[b]Hi Mechanics![/b]

It's been a real joy for us to hear about your experiences with the new Challange mode. We had no idea there was such an impressive amount of skilled mechanics out there that just burned through all 40 Challenges in no time! 

Thankfully, those 40 were just the beginning. We've only scratched the surface of what we can do with Challange mode and next up is the Challange builder that makes it easy for you and your friends to build and share your own Challange packs on the workshop. Itâ€™s up on the test branch right now for testing!

Here is how you enter the test branch:

Keep in mind that you have to beat your own challenges to get them approved for sharing on the workshop. This is so we can make sure that all the challenges that get uploaded can be completed. 

While we are at it, work on Survival mode is going great. 
We are right now doing work on less interesting things in the background of the game that knits the Survival mode together. But we should be back soon with a new devblog with a lot of new things.
