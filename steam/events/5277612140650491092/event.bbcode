[b]Hi Mechanics![/b]

You mechanics keep sharing truly impressive creations so we felt it was time to throw off the Farmbot’s shackles and show off another bunch of Scrap Mechanic Hidden Gems! Since the last Hidden Gems post, we’ve released the logic gate and the timer, and you really seem to be making good use of them - so this month’s post is all about them. Remember, you can find all of this items on Steam Workshop, through the links included.

[b]Scrap-A-Tat-Tat![/b] 
As we’ve added lots more sounds to the Totebot heads in the last update, we really wanted to try them out. Drum Machine Mini by Stamsite was perfect for that! This rhythm-tastic creation allows you to rattle off bass and drum loops easier than 3/4 time. But be warned. Once you start to get into the groove, it’s hard to stop playing with this creation. Are you a good Scrap Musician?

[b]Tic Tac Totally Amazing[/b]
Friends are great. For running over or dropping cars on. But sometimes you want to work together to, y’know, make something impressive. And it’s not always easy to agree what to make. 
Which is where this awesome Tic Tac Toe machine by Voldakk steps in. It can help you settle who’s in charge with a fun session of noughts and crosses. To prevent cheating, it even track of whose turn it is, displays who won each round on the logic gate screen and lets you know if there was a draw. Now your only problem will be stopping playing...

[b]Space, Invaded[/b]
Brent Batch is back! We’ve featured his creations before (notably his mind-blowing Strandbeest-like Fancy Walker), but he’s excelled himself again. Using the new logic gates and timers, he’s built a fully functional version of an arcade classic that you might recognize, complete with a life counter, score counter, and various difficulty levels. It’s a complete game-within-game! Even the Farmbots can’t stop playing, though they get a bit mad when the flying saucer doesn’t turn up…

 [b]Timed Movie Camera[/b]
Coelacanths are ancient amphibious fish, living fossils. Yet one by the name of coelacanth0715 has abandoned 360 million years of sitting quietly on the ocean bottom to move to Japan and spend their time modding Scrap Mechanic instead. Their creation is an in-game camera that records a fifteen-second loop. Step in front of the sensors on the device’s back and throw some shapes. Fifteen seconds later, it’ll show them back to you on the logic gate screen. A pretty amazing creation that you should check out.

 [b]Cruise Control[/b]
Hailing from the Netherlands, OttoNL has made a fleet of awesome cars for Scrap Mechanic - we particularly like his two-player car, which reminds of a certain double-decker couch… but he’s surpassed himself this time with some help from his friend eriyo2000. their latest automobile is the Autonomous Bugatti Chiron. While Google, Uber and the rest spend billions researching self-driving cars, Otto and eriyo2000 has beaten them to the punch - this Bugatti drives completely by itself! All you have to do is grab a seat and flick the switch then it will take you on an adventure to unknown places. Hopefully not off a cliff. 
We’ve had great fun building obstacle courses in the flat world to see how well this self-driving car handles them. OttoNL even has a ready race track for this car in his workshop.
