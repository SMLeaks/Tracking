Hi Mechanics!

We know that some of you have requested more sensor settings.
So we decided to make it possible to set the range. You can now also set the sensor so it behaves like a button or a switch. Sound can also be turned on and off. 

Here are the patch notes:
[list]
*Sensors have a new interface that allows the player to set range and other settings.
*Increased lift height from 16 blocks to 20 blocks.
*Added more tips to the loading screen.
*Camera collision check fixes.
