Hi Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
We know that some of you have requested more sensor settings.<br/>
So we decided to make it possible to set the range. You can now also set the sensor so it behaves like a button or a switch. Sound can also be turned on and off. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Sensors have a new interface that allows the player to set range and other settings.<br/>
* Increased lift height from 16 blocks to 20 blocks.<br/>
* Added more tips to the loading screen.<br/>
* Camera collision check fixes.<br/>
