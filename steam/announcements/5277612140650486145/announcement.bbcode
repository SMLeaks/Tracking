Today we are doing a little improvement update test. 
Weâ€™ve been looking at all the creative ways you use the explosives and decided to do some further improvements. 
For example, blowing up larger creations with a lot of explosives should now run a bit smoother.
We also did some other fixes!


Check out the update list:
[list]
[*]Parts that are split of from creations inherit the velocities of the creation.
[*] Optimized explosions.
[*] The range that explosions remove metal has been reduced.
[*] Changed the particle effect that appears on the point where potatoes hit the gas canister.
[*] Fixed connect tool attaching to invisible gas canister connection points.
[*] Fixed a networking issue that caused crashes when playing as a client.
[*] Fixed a rendering issue that could cause a crash when some parts were destroyed by an explosion.
[*] Fixed an issue where the impulses were applied with half strength if the game was running on low fps.
[*] Multiple explosion impulses on the character have less effect.
[*] More explosion particles should be visible.
[*] Mods with no translation for the selected language will now default to English.
[*] Added more helpful error messages.
[*] Fix for lowest playable resolution (1024x768) defaulting to 1280x720.
