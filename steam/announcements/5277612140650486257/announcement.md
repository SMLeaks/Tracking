**Hi Mechanics!**


We have a really fun update for you today! We’ve added a large and small explosive canister to the game. They are highly explosive so please save your creations before playing with them. They do a LOT of damage!
There are several ways of making them blow up. One is by shooting them with a Spud Gun. Another way is by making them collide with a strong enough force.
Together with the canister, we’ve also added material damage to the game where for example metal blocks take less damage than wood blocks. 

We have balanced the canisters collision sensitivity a lot and we think it’s better now. However, we might tweak them more over time.

We have also added smoother movement to the tools and the spud gun in first-person when landing from a jump or looking around. It feels much nicer now.

If you are a modder you will also love the things that we’ve added!
Check out our Lua Script API to see what’s new!
