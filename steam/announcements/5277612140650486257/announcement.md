**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We have a really fun update for you today! We’ve added a large and small explosive canister to the game. They are highly explosive so please save your creations before playing with them. They do a LOT of damage!<br/>
There are several ways of making them blow up. One is by shooting them with a Spud Gun. Another way is by making them collide with a strong enough force.<br/>
Together with the canister, we’ve also added material damage to the game where for example metal blocks take less damage than wood blocks. <br/>
<br/>
We have balanced the canisters collision sensitivity a lot and we think it’s better now. However, we might tweak them more over time.<br/>
<br/>
We have also added smoother movement to the tools and the spud gun in first-person when landing from a jump or looking around. It feels much nicer now.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a modder you will also love the things that we’ve added!<br/>
