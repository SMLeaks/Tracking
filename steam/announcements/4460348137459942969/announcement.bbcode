[b]Hi Mechanics![/b]
We’ve got a surprise update for you today:
The “Physics and Wedge Update”!

While the next chapter is still in development, we didn’t want to hold back some exciting features that could enhance your gameplay experience right away. Plus, this gives us the chance to test these features with all of you!

So what’s in here?

[b]Improved Physics[/b]
This update brings a major overhaul to the physics system, unlocking new possibilities and significantly reducing lag. Creations can now collide with each other, and loose items can be thrown around or stacked in larger amounts.

Our team has worked hard to optimize the physics in Scrap Mechanic, tackling this challenge head-on. While the performance boost will vary depending on your hardware, these improvements should make a noticeable difference! 
However, this update doesn’t fix issues with large, super-complex creations lagging within themselves, as that’s a separate issue we’re still addressing.

IMPORTANT: New worlds will have the new smart physics on by default. However, old worlds will need to be set to the new physics setting manually. You find this setting under 
Options > Gameplay > Physics quality – Then select: Smart (Recommended) 
Good to keep in mind that only the host in multiplayer can adjust the physics quality.

[b]Wedges![/b]
We’re thrilled to announce that wedges have finally arrived as a new building block! All block materials now have a wedge version, making it possible to create shapes and designs that weren’t achievable before. We’re excited to see what amazing builds you’ll come up with using this new addition!

[b]Network Optimizations[/b]
We’ve also made significant improvements to multiplayer performance. With these changes, along with the updated physics, playing with friends should now feel smoother and more enjoyable than ever.

[b]New & Updated Parts[/b]
This update includes some exciting new parts and tweaks to existing ones. The Farmbot Target Part lets you create your very own shooting range, and the Window with Curtains adds extra flair to your builds by allowing you to open and close them. Additionally, we’ve unlocked some spaceship parts in Creative mode that were previously only available in Survival mode.

We hope you enjoy everything this update has to offer!

At last, a note about the next chapter.
We’ve made some amazing progress this year!
But we are still not happy with some segments of the chapter that require more 
work and fixes. We are sorry to keep you waiting so long. 
We are still hard at work on the next chapter!


Stay creative,
The Scrap Mechanic Team
