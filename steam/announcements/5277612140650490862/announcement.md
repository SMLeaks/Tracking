**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We know we have some mechanics who much rather play <br/>
Scrap Mechanic in their mother tongue. So today we have added <br/>
German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish and Brazilian Portuguese to the test branch! <br/>
They are pretty much complete. There are just a few items missing translation that will be added soon. <br/>
<br/>
Up next we will be adding translation for <br/>
Russian, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
This is how you access the test branch!<br/>

<br/>
On a different note. <br/>
The work on the engine is going great. <br/>
We also have more exciting things in the works that we will show in the coming weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned mechanics!<br/>
