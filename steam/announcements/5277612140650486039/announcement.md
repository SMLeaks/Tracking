**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
Time for a little improvement update!<br/>
Thanks to all mechanics for the help testing it out during the test! We got some great feedback as always.<br/>
Weâ€™ve been looking at all the creative ways you use the new explosives and decided to do some further improvements. <br/>
For example, blowing up larger creations with a lot of explosives should now run a bit smoother.<br/>
We also did some other fixes!<br/>
<br/>
Check out the update list:<br/>
<br/>
* Parts that are split of from creations inherit the velocities of the creation.<br/>
* Optimized explosions.<br/>
* The range that explosions remove metal has been reduced.<br/>
* Changed the particle effect that appears on the point where potatoes hit the gas canister.<br/>
* Tweaked the explosion impulse on players.<br/>
* Fixed connect tool attaching to invisible gas canister connection points.<br/>
* Fixed a networking issue that caused crashes when playing as a client.<br/>
* Fixed a rendering issue that could cause a crash when some parts were destroyed by an explosion.<br/>
* Fixed an issue where the impulses (from thruster and modded parts) were applied with half strength if the game was running on low fps.<br/>
* Multiple explosion impulses on the character have less effect.<br/>
* More explosion debris particles should now be visible.<br/>
* Mods with no translation for the selected language will now default to English.<br/>
* Added more helpful error messages.<br/>
* Fix for lowest playable resolution (1024x768) defaulting to 1280x720.<br/>
* [Lua API updates](http://scrapmechanic.com/api/whats_new.html) (no breaking changes).<br/>
* Scripted interactive parts no longer incorrectly show up as buttons when connected to a seat.<br/>
* Character impulses are applied per tick instead of every frame.<br/>
* Fixed "Server started with mismatching developer mode flags" issue when loading games.<br/>
* Fixed a networking related crash.<br/>
* Fixed a crash that was caused by an invalid terrain generation script or an invalid world builder terrain.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Time for us to go back working on Survival mode and Challange mode.<br/>
Both are coming along nicely!<br/>
