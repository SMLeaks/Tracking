**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
<1>IMPORTANT <br/>
* Keep in mind that if you open old worlds on the test branch, you will not be able to play in those worlds outside of the test branch anymore until the final explosive update release!<br/>
* We will do improvements and changes during the test period. Things can change.</1><br/>
<br/>
We have a really fun and explosive test for you today. We’ve added a large and small explosive canister for testing. They are highly explosive so please save your creations before playing with them. They do a LOT of damage!<br/>
There are several ways of making them blow up. One is by shooting them with a Spud Gun. Another way is by making them collide with a large enough force.<br/>
Together with the canister, we’ve also added material damage to the game where for example metal blocks take less damage than wood blocks. <br/>
<br/>
We have also added smoother movement to the tools and the spud gun in first-person when landing from a jump or looking around. It feels much nicer now.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a modder you will also love the things that we’ve added!<br/>
Check out our Lua Script API to see what’s new!<br/>

These changes will not be available to players who are not playing the test version. Please take this into consideration before uploading mods to the workshop.<br/>
