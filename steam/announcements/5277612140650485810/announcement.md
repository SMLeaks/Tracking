**Hi Mechanics!**


We’ve just uploaded a very early test for the new Challange Mode. It’s now playable on the test branch. It contains a very stripped down version of 3 simple challenges. 

Please keep in mind when testing that there are a lot of things still missing in this test that will be added in the final release. 
We would really appreciate if we could get help from our amazing community to test it out and see how it runs, so we can deal with as many possible crashes and bugs before the final release. 

**Here is how you access the test!**

We will be back soon with a lot more Challange Mode fun!
