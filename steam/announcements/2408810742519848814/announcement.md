*Updated June 23*<br/>
**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We updated the test again with some changes to the network code.<br/>
<br/>
* Fixed an issue that could cause network lag for clients<br/><br/>

**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We have updated the test with some more stuff!<br/>
In the updated version we made a lot of small changes that should make the overall experience of the game smoother. For example, since cotton can be scarce in some worlds, you can now buy cotton seeds at the hideout trader and plant them yourself.<br/>
In addition to that, we also made further networking improvements with better bandwidth adjustment and object prioritization. This will make the game work much better when playing multiplayer over slower connections.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Further networking improvements with better bandwidth adjustment and object prioritization<br/>
* Cotton seeds can now be bought at the hideout trader<br/>
* Cotton can be grown in soil<br/>
* Slightly reduced the price of the drill and saw blade at the hideout trader<br/>
* Battery is now crafted from less scrap metal but also requires glow poop<br/>
* Fixed an issue that could make the leaves of trees to not get their correct color in multiplayer<br/>
* Fixed an issue where failed blueprint exports would cause an error message to show at game startup<br/>
* The button and switch collision is a little bit bigger so they do not as easily get stuck in walls<br/>

* Added lights to ruins<br/>

* Mechanic station collision fixes<br/>
* Adjusted the stone positions of a lot of cliffs where the player could get stuck<br/>
* Adjusted spawn position of embers when destroying burnt trees<br/>
* The scrap metal from haybots will not fly away from where the haybot was destroyed as often<br/>
* The smaller stone chunks are easier to destroy with the drill<br/>
* Fixed a bug that caused the gas engine to not get the efficiency upgrade applied until game reload<br/>
* Reduced gas fuel cost for very heavy loads<br/>
* The range of the packing station automatic fruit/vegetable selection is much more forgiving<br/>
