**Hi Mechanics! **<br/>
Creative mode Update 0.5.0 is finally here!<br/>
<br/>
**New creative mode worlds**<br/>
Welcome to the new and updated creative mode! Not only did we make it look better to go hand in hand with the survival world but we also finally added water to the creative terrain. All trees can now be cut down and rocks can be drilled. Excellent for testing out ideas for your creations in Survival mode. We also gave the flat world an updated ground texture. <br/>
The new one should give a much better sense of movement and speed.<br/>
<br/>
**New capsules**<br/>
Both bot and animal capsules have been added to creative mode. <br/>
Place them on the ground then shot or hit a capsule to release them into your world. <br/>
There is a lot of fun things you can do with these. Check the useful chat commands below. <br/>
<br/>
**Bot combat**<br/>
Paint bots in different colors and see them attack each other.<br/>
This new feature is great fun and allows you to set up large bot fights. <br/>
The red tape boat also got a slight redesign to make it easy to see the difference between blue and red when painted. We are very happy with this new feature turned out and we are excited to see how you use it. <br/>
<br/>
**Gameplay tab and physics quality slider **<br/>
We added a new gameplay tab in the in-game options menu. <br/>
This tab will let us add a mix of settings in the future for the player to adjust their gameplay and performance. First up is the physics quality slider. This slider is great for when setting up larger bot battles or when you are doing something where a lot of loose parts and blocks fall on the ground. Itâ€™s however not useful for creations with bearings unless you want to make wacky creations. This is just one stab towards making the game run even smoother and better. More to come!<br/>
<br/>
**Custom main menu**<br/>
You can now decorate your main menu by pressing the blue pen icon on the bottom. <br/>
This will take you into the main menu world where you can build. You can also spawn your favorite creation from the lift and have it on display. Currently, the main menu does not support moving bearings and is only for static creations. <br/>
<br/>
**New useful chat commands **<br/>
Lastly! We also added a lot of fun and useful commands for creative mode. <br/>
