Hi Mechanics, <br/>
<br/>
We are currently busy working on bigger updates.<br/>
But here are some small fixes we wanted to add right away that will improve <br/>
the gameplay further for you.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Fixed a memory allocation issue related to a particle system. Scrap Mechanic now uses much less memory. This could increase fps drastically for some players. It could also fix a crash when starting/loading a game for some players.<br/>
* More visible thruster particles.<br/>
* Multiplayer optimization on building and updating shapes.<br/>
