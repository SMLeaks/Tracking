Hi Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
We’re so stoked to be able to tell you Scrap Mechanic has now sold over 100,000 copies!<br/>
<br/>
This has blown us away (and actually melted our lil’ mechanic hearts a bit), and now – even though we’re up to our necks in optimising the game – we wanna give something back to you guys so we can celebrate this milestone together. Today, we’re excited to release the horn! as well as some other big improvements. <br/>
Here is the full list:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Horn - A new interactive part that will complete your vehicles. Beep beep!<br/>
* Thruster - You can now set the thruster power on each thruster.<br/>
* Seat - The Mechanic no longer pretends to be holding on to a steering wheel.<br/>
* Fixed vehicles suddenly jumping around like crazy and being uncontrollable in multiplayer.<br/>
* Fixed a bug that could crash the game while placing stuff.<br/>
* Fixed a crash related to some graphics cards<br/>
* Fixed the Radio that sometimes prevented other players from hearing the wonderful music in multiplayer.<br/>
* Things now respond better when hit by the sledgehammer in multiplayer.<br/>
* The Mechanic does not stretch out anymore when pressing E on seats.<br/>
* The friction has been adjusted on blocks and parts so they slide a bit more.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s give a celebratory blast on these horns to celebrate our little Scrap Army now being more than 100,000 strong!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your support!<br/>
