Hi Mechanics!

We’re so stoked to be able to tell you Scrap Mechanic has now sold over 100,000 copies!

This has blown us away (and actually melted our lil’ mechanic hearts a bit), and now – even though we’re up to our necks in optimising the game – we wanna give something back to you guys so we can celebrate this milestone together. Today, we’re excited to release the horn! as well as some other big improvements. 
Here is the full list:

[list]
*Horn - A new interactive part that will complete your vehicles. Beep beep!
*Thruster - You can now set the thruster power on each thruster.
*Seat - The Mechanic no longer pretends to be holding on to a steering wheel.
*Fixed vehicles suddenly jumping around like crazy and being uncontrollable in multiplayer.
*Fixed a bug that could crash the game while placing stuff.
*Fixed a crash related to some graphics cards
*Fixed the Radio that sometimes prevented other players from hearing the wonderful music in multiplayer.
*Things now respond better when hit by the sledgehammer in multiplayer.
*The Mechanic does not stretch out anymore when pressing E on seats.
*The friction has been adjusted on blocks and parts so they slide a bit more.

Let’s give a celebratory blast on these horns to celebrate our little Scrap Army now being more than 100,000 strong!

Thanks for all your support!
