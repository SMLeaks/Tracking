Hi Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
We have a new patch for you today!<br/>
This one should fix a few issues that some players have reported. <br/>
Hopefully next week we can release more content.<br/>
We have some fun stuff in the works!<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Fixed an issue related to the multithreading update that randomly crashed the game.<br/>
* Fixed an issue that would sometimes make creations and players in them disappear.<br/>
* Disappeared creations and players should respawn at the starting position.<br/>
* Fixed an issue that could make creations with thrusters on them disappear if the game crashed while they were on a lift.<br/>
* Fixed a crash that could occur when exiting a game.<br/><br/>
Thanks for all the support!
