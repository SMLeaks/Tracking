**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
As you might have noticed, the creative mode terrain is built out of big and small tiles with different terrain on them. <br/>
Every time a new world is created. You get a terrain randomly generated by some of these tiles. <br/>
We wanted to add more variation with caves, jumps, ramps and huge mountains where you can put your vehicles to the test.<br/>
<br/>
In the future we plan to make it possible to select the tiles you want your world to be made of and even allow you to make your own in our terrain editor. But for now it will have to be a surprise every time you create a world. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the update notes:<br/>
