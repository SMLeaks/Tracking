**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We are excited to finally drop this update!<br/>
This update will lay out some of the groundwork for the upcoming new survival chapter that we are working on right now. In this update we did a ton of bug fixes and improvements. We also added a few new fun things to survival mode like the Beacon and the Logbook! We know this is not a huge update. But rest assured that a big survival update is in the works with a lot of new content and itâ€™s shaping up to become something amazing!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Beacon**<br/>
Beacon is a very useful new interactive part that will help you set navigation waypoints in the world. This will make exploration much easier. It can now be crafted in the Craftbot!<br/>

**Logbook**<br/>
The Logbook can now be unlocked in the crashed ship. <br/>
It will store all quests that the mechanics will find in the world. It also lets mechanics manage all active Beacons in the world. The logbook will be very important in the next chapter where quests will be introduced. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Oil in Desert Biome**<br/>
We heard you! A lot of Mechanics wanted to pump oil from the ground. That is now possible if you can find a desert biome with an oil pool. You will not need to start a new world. Good luck on your adventure!<br/>
<br/>
