**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
The official mod support is finally here!<br/>
We would like to give a big thanks to all mechanics that have been giving us feedback during the testing period. But also a big thanks to all the modders that have uploaded their amazing mods to the workshop! <br/>
You can check them out [HERE](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=387990&requiredtags%5B%5D=Blocks+and+Parts)<br/>
<br/>
Right now it’s only possible to make blocks and part mods. But we will make more things possible as we keep developing Survival Mode. This is just the first step.<br/>
<br/>
For all mechanics that are interested in making their own mods with blocks and parts. <br/>
We have made a guide to help you get started!<br/>
You can check it out here [Mod Guide](http://scrapmechanic.gamepedia.com/Modding)<br/>
<br/>
We’ve also published a set of guidelines to help mechanics understand how to make the most of the new tool, along with some changes to our terms and conditions, including to explain:<br/>
<br/>
* Who can use the tools and mods<br/>
* Who owns mods and how to respect the work of others<br/>
* Some important rules and things to avoid when modding<br/>
* Some guidance on how to make the most out of your mods<br/><br/>
We think these changes and guidelines are important to make sure the Scrap Mechanic modding community continues to be an open, friendly and fun place, which encourages creativity, sharing and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Before you get started make sure to:<br/>
<br/>
* Read the latest version of our EULA here: [EULA](http://store.steampowered.com/eula/387990_eula_0)<br/>
* Look through our modding community guidelines here: [Modding guidelines](http://scrapmechanic.com/modding-guidelines)<br/>
* Then, get your hands on the tool by clicking tools on the steam library tab!<br/><br/>
<br/>
We are really looking forward to see what you mechanics will build with <br/>
the new mods!<br/>
