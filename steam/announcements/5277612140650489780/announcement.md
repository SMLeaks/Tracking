**Hi Mechanics!**


The official mod support is finally here!
We would like to give a big thanks to all mechanics that have been giving us feedback during the testing period. But also a big thanks to all the modders that have uploaded their amazing mods to the workshop! 
You can check them out [HERE](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=387990&requiredtags%5B%5D=Blocks+and+Parts)

Right now it’s only possible to make blocks and part mods. But we will make more things possible as we keep developing Survival Mode. This is just the first step.

For all mechanics that are interested in making their own mods with blocks and parts. 
We have made a guide to help you get started!
You can check it out here [Mod Guide](http://scrapmechanic.gamepedia.com/Modding)

We’ve also published a set of guidelines to help mechanics understand how to make the most of the new tool, along with some changes to our terms and conditions, including to explain:
[list]
*Who can use the tools and mods
*Who owns mods and how to respect the work of others
*Some important rules and things to avoid when modding
*Some guidance on how to make the most out of your mods
[/list]
We think these changes and guidelines are important to make sure the Scrap Mechanic modding community continues to be an open, friendly and fun place, which encourages creativity, sharing and respect.

Before you get started make sure to:
[list]
*Read the latest version of our EULA here: [EULA](http://store.steampowered.com/eula/387990_eula_0)
*Look through our modding community guidelines here: [Modding guidelines](http://scrapmechanic.com/modding-guidelines)
*Then, get your hands on the tool by clicking tools on the steam library tab!
[/list]

We are really looking forward to see what you mechanics will build with 
the new mods!
