**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We managed to free up some extra time this week to work on some important fixes! <br/>
One of the bigger ones is a physics optimization that should help with frame drops a lot. Now the physics "go to sleep" much faster, making worlds with a lot of creations to run better.<br/>
All the fixes are up for testing on the test branch now!<br/>
We would love to hear how the test works for you.<br/>
<br/>
**Here is how you access it!**<br/>

Here is the full update list!<br/>
<br/>
* Now you can only join games where your friends are playing. <br/>
We heard that there were some sneaky mechanics joining other players without an invite trough an exploit. This is now fixed. <br/>
We will add more privacy settings in the future.<br/>
* Made a big physics improvement so physics fall asleep and stop to collision check when they stop to move. This will get the frames up a lot in worlds with a lot of creations.<br/>
* Made so the game has faster startup and less stutter when browsing inventory<br/>
* The sensor sound is now off by default.<br/>
* Collision will now have the correct audio<br/>
* Terrain features needed for survival and terrain modding support is added.<br/>
This will not be visible to the player at this stage.<br/>
* Made improvements to the animation system<br/><br/>
<br/>
We will be back soon with more awesome stuff!<br/>
