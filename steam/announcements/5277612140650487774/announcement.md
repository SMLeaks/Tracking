<br/>
**(Updated December 15)**<br/>
In this update, we added a very early version of the world builder. <br/>
Please keep in mind that a lot of things are still missing. <br/>
But we already want to start testing it. <br/>

**Hi Mechanics**<br/>
<br/>
As some of you following us on Twitter might have noticed, we are currently working on a World Builder and a Tile Builder. These builders will give you all the awesome tools you need to create and share worlds via Steam Workshop. In preparation for this update we will start doing a few tests on the test branch. <br/>
We are starting out with some necessary fixes like faster texture loading as well as improved frame rate when loading creations from the lift. We even added 3 new terrain tiles made in the Tile Builder. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the full update list. <br/>
<br/>
* Added better and smoother lods.<br/>
* Added 3 new world tiles to creative mode.<br/>
* Faster texture loading.<br/>
* Better texture quality.<br/>
* Faster terrain loading.<br/>
* Less lag when loading creations from the lift.<br/><br/>
<br/>
As always! We would be happy if you can help us test it out and let us know if<br/>
everything works well. We have made a lot of changes to our game engine as well so this test build can be a little unstable.<br/>
<br/>
<1>When you enter a world in this test, you will no longer be able to open the world outside of the test branch. So please don't test this update in your favorite worlds.</1><br/>

We hope to add the World Builder and the Tile Builder to the test branch soon. <br/>
Time for us to get back to work! Stay tuned Mechanics!<br/>
