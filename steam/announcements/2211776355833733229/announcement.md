**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
We are back with a bunch more important improvements. This time we have made a lot more fixing in the raid department. We have found ways to optimize them more so they donâ€™t trigger lag when a lot of bots come at once. This fix should make raids way more enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the latest fixes!<br/>
<br/>
Hotfix:<br/>
<br/>
* Fixed an issue that could cause creations attached to the ground to become loose<br/><br/>
Patch notes 0.4.4: <br/>
<br/>
* Performance fix for raids<br/>
* Fixed an issue where exiting the game in a warehouse caused the elevator to the roof to get stuck<br/>
* Fixed a case where building on springs or piston could spend the part but the part not to be built<br/>
* Removing bearings, springs and pistons with a full inventory is now correctly denied<br/>
* Fixed a crash that could occur when riding warehouse elevators<br/>
* Fixed a crash that could occur when using a level 5 steering bearing gui on 720 resolution<br/>
* Other crash fixes<br/>
* Water-, gas-, battery- and ammo containers are carried if not empty (like the chests)<br/>
* Farmers can no longer be picked up after being respawned<br/>
* Fixed issue with piston speed when adjusting length<br/>
* Fixed an issue what allows invalid building on the vacuum pump<br/>
* Fixed a bug causing the saw blade to not deal damage to green totebots<br/>
* The saw blade deals more damage to haybots<br/>
* When removing a respawn point bed the new respawn point is the last unremovable bed<br/>
* Can no longer respawn in a bed brought into the warehouse<br/>
* Red tapebot arm part shoots a few explosive tape when destroyed<br/>
* Fixed an issue with the tapebots causing them to often stare into walls in warehouses<br/>
* Tapebots will be more active in raids when they come (Keep your head low)<br/>
* Tapebot projectiles deal damage to crops <br/>
* Ai fixes<br/>
* Fix for mods using obj_interactive_controller.mesh<br/><br/>
<br/>
