[b]Hi Mechanics![/b]

We are back with a bunch more important improvements. This time we have made a lot more fixing in the raid department. We have found ways to optimize them more so they donâ€™t trigger lag when a lot of bots come at once. This fix should make raids way more enjoyable. 


Here are the latest fixes!

[list]
[*] Fixed an issue that could cause creations attached to the ground to become loose

[*] Farmers can no longer be picked up after being respawned
[*] Fixed issue with piston speed when adjusting length
[*] Fixed an issue what allows invalid building on the vacuum pump
[*] Fixed a bug causing the saw blade to not deal damage to green totebots
