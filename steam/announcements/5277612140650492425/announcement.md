**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the Weld Tool update came with some multiplayer issues that made it <br/>
difficult to play with friends. This is now fixed!<br/>
As thanks for your patience we have added two new building parts. <br/>
The large windshield and the small windshield.<br/>
Hope you like them!<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Fixed multiplayer join issues.<br/>
* Fixed a crash that occurred when the object picked up by weld tool was modified by another player.<br/>
* Added two new parts. The large windshield and the small windshield.<br/><br/>
