**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
0.2.9 is finally here!<br/>
This update improves on a lot of things. <br/>
One of the bigger things is a physics optimization that should help with frame drops a lot. Now the physics "go to sleep" much faster, making worlds with a lot of creations to run better.<br/>
<br/>
We are focusing a lot on survival mode right now. These smaller but important fixes that we do from time to time will help survival mode run much better once we release it. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the full update list!<br/>
<br/>
* Now you can only join games where your friends are playing. <br/>
We heard that there were some sneaky mechanics joining other players without an invite through an exploit. This is now fixed. <br/>
We will add more privacy settings in the future.<br/>
* Made a big physics improvement so physics fall asleep and stop to collision check when they stop to move. This will get the frames up a lot in worlds with a lot of creations.<br/>
* Made so the game has a faster startup and less stutter when browsing inventory.<br/>
* The sensor sound is now off by default.<br/>
* Collision will now have the correct audio.<br/>
* Terrain features needed for survival and terrain modding support is added.<br/>
This will not be visible to the player at this stage.<br/>
* Made improvements to the animation system.<br/>
* The mod tool now creates more cache that will make the game start faster and make the inventory stutter less. We recommend modders to re-upload their mods. This will trigger the extra caching.<br/><br/>
Hotfixed:<br/>
<br/>
* Fixed a bug that prevented new blueprints from being built.<br/>
<br/>
Next week we will be back with a new devblog and we also have a big announcement coming soon!<br/>
Stay tuned mechanics!<br/>
