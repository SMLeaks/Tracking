**Hi Mechanics**

We are really stoked to finally release the Tile Editor for player testing. It’s on the test branch now!

The test version has all the tools you need to make your own worlds and share them with other mechanics on Steam Workshop. We can’t wait to see what kind of worlds and crazy stunt tracks you will create!

We also plan to recommend some of the most impressive tiles to our community in time for the editor’s full release, so if you make something you feel particularly proud of during the test period, please tweet us a workshop link before the 29th!

**Here is how you access the test branch:**
