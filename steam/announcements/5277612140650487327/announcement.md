**Greetings Mechanics!**<br/>
The Tile Builder is finally here! This powerful tool will allow you to create your own amazing worlds and share them with other Mechanics via Steam Workshop!<br/>
<br/>
Need a specific world setup for your creations? Now you can make it. Want to challenge your friends on your own stunt course, now it’s possible. The Tile Builder opens up a ton of creative freedom for the community!<br/>
<br/>
Check out the new Tile Builder trailer!<br/>

During the testing period we collected a ton of useful feedback from the community (thanks to all the Mechanics who helped us!), however it’s worth keeping in mind that Tile Builder is still at the early stages and we will continue to fine tuning things in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The Tile Builder was originally a tool we needed when working on Survival Mode, but we soon realised it would make a great tool for the community to use as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are already hundreds of impressive tiles on the Workshop made by our awesome community. Here are a few fun race tracks that we found!<br/>
