**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
Time for another awesome little update.<br/>
A lot of you symmetry-loving Mechanics have been asking for a new Driver’s seat that is 3 blocks wide. So we made the Driver’s saddle! Great for more compact vehicles and it’s also light weight.<br/>
We also added a new feature to the Lift that lets you rotate your creation with Q before placing it down. Really useful for bigger flying machines. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Added Driver’s Saddle <br/>
* Added Saddle<br/>
* When you pick up creations on the lift, you can now rotate them with Q before placing the lift down.<br/>
* Better collision detection for the lift placement.<br/>
* Seat GUI should no longer get stuck when ejecting from the seats.<br/>
* Made the glass windows more clear from the inside.<br/>
* Fixed a bug caused by the introduction of volume sliders for the Totebot Heads.<br/>
* Made sensors more responsive.<br/><br/>
Keep in mind that these small updates we do weekly or bi-weekly do not affect the work we do on optimization, bigger requested features or survival mode. <br/>
The weld tool is just behind the corner!<br/>

We at Scrap Mechanic HQ wish you a creative weekend!<br/>
