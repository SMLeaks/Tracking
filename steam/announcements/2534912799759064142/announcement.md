**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
It’s time to move all the things we tested into the game!<br/>
Thanks for all the amazing feedback! Here are some of the new things in this update. Cotton plants can now be planted on your farm. You can trade for Cotton seeds at the Farmer hideout. We decided to add these seeds since some players had a hard time finding cotton in their generated world. We will do the same with pigment flowers in the future. We’ve also added the Chemical container to the Craftbot. It’s not very useful at the moment, but we have things in the works where it will have an important function. Lastly, we also did a lot of balancing tweaks based on the community feedback! <br/>
