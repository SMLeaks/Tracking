**Hi Mechanics!** <br/>
<br/>
We have a new update coming soon! <br/>
But the awesome thing is that you can already try it now on our test branch.<br/>
As always we like to try things out before we add it to the main branch to make sure everything works great!<br/>
<br/>
Here is what we added<br/>
<br/>
* Follow camera and a camera setting.<br/>
* Updated thruster particles that now have dynamic lighting and trigger dust when close to the ground.<br/>
* Rotate between three hotbars with alt+q or access them directly with alt+1/2/3.<br/>
* Items are saved in the hotbar when joining other players.<br/>
* Did some render optimizations that fix the slowdowns when placing/deleting blocks on huge creations.<br/>
* Added bathtub. A new interactive part!<br/>
* Added a mug part.<br/>
All of these have been requested by our awesome Scrap Mechanic community!<br/>
<br/>
<1>This is how you access the test branch!</1><br/>
