**Hi Mechanics!** 


We have a new update coming soon! 
But the awesome thing is that you can already try it now on our test branch.
As always we like to try things out before we add it to the main branch to make sure everything works great!

Here is what we added
[list]
*Follow camera and a camera setting.
*Updated thruster particles that now have dynamic lighting and trigger dust when close to the ground.
*Rotate between three hotbars with alt+q or access them directly with alt+1/2/3.
*Items are saved in the hotbar when joining other players.
*Did some render optimizations that fix the slowdowns when placing/deleting blocks on huge creations.
*Added bathtub. A new interactive part!
*Added a mug part.[/list]
All of these have been requested by our awesome Scrap Mechanic community!
