Hi Mechanics!<br/>
In the previous patch the physics did not behave as intended.<br/>
We have disabled the multi threaded physics while we investigate what causes this.<br/>
<br/>
The following updates are still live though:<br/>
<br/>
* Things no longer get stuck in the ground.<br/>
* Fixed a startup crash that occurred for some users.<br/>
* Added new building parts.<br/>
<br/>
* Mattress<br/>
* Arrow Sign<br/>
* 3 Potted plants<br/>
* Toilet Seat<br/><br/><br/>
<br/>
Also, not related to this patch but important to know!<br/>
In a recent update to the Steam Beta Client there is an issue with Steam Overlay in Scrap Mechanic, causing low fps.<br/>
If you experience low fps, plz check the troubleshooting thread on the forums.<br/>
