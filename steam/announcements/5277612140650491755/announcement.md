**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
The Farmbots are keeping us working hard over here at Scrap HQ, but we’re not the only ones. You’ve all been busy too and we keep seeing you all sharing some amazing creations. So it’s time to dig into the Scrap Mechanic workshop for some hidden gems! <br/>

 **The Fancy Walker** <br/>
One of the inspirations for Scrap Mechanic before the development started was [Theo Jansen’s incredible Strandbeests](http://www.strandbeest.com). They’re delicate automata that use air pressure to create believably organic movement. With that in mind, it’s amazing to see how well this Strandbeest was re-created in Scrap Mechanic by top creator Brent Batch. We could spend hours just watching this beautiful thing walk.<br/>

 **The Mobile Music Box**<br/>
Feeling down? Is your day a bit of a bummer? Did your flying contraption escape into the sunset? Well, we have the right thing to cheer you up! Gum The Mechanic has built a music box on wheels that plays a jaunty, happy tune. Cruising around with this vehicle while jamming along puts a big smile on our faces - and we think it should do the same for you. <br/>

 **Have A Banana**<br/>
What could be so special about a wooden banana? I mean, you can’t even eat it, unless you like spending a week picking splinters out of your tongue. That’s what we thought until we found… this banana. <br/>
Luap the Great has managed to build a very clever and compact… banana. We’re not going to spoil it for you. Just subscribe, hit the switch and stand back! You won’t regret it. <br/>

 **Farmbot: The Prerevengeance**<br/>
We don’t know how it happened. Someone must have left a door open. Whatever the reason, the survival mode isn’t even out yet but the Farmbots have got out and are invading Steam Workshop. Mechanic Fabiano Luiz seems to have spotted one, which he’s captured and uploaded. <br/>
This Farmbot is an agricultural giant who tromps over the land like something out of Transformers and will even open his mouth when you get too close. The last we saw of Fabiano was in this [short movie when he encountered this mechanical monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ntyFRta_uU). Are you brave enough to subscribe?<br/>

 **Hello Dolly(cam)**<br/>
Eru is one clever mechanic. He’s built a lot of impressive things, from helicopters and flying lawnmowers to the Iron Throne itself. This creation is much more practical - a camera dolly vehicle for taking steady moving videos. If you want to make a movie showing off your latest creations, then this cunning vehicle produces impressive cinematic sweeping shots. It’s easy to operate - [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxrDGtG2lUk&feature=youtu.be) for more details and some inspiration.<br/>
