Hi Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
We have a new patch for you today!<br/>
This one should fix a few issues that some players have reported.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* The controller should no longer break your creations when logging in to a world. This does not fix creations that are already broken previously by this bug. <br/>
* Bearings controlled by the controller should now behave better.<br/>
* Objects can no longer be removed while seated.<br/>
* "Use" [E] can now be used to close the interface of any interactive part.<br/>
