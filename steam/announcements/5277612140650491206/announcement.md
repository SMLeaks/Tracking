**Hi Mechanics!** <br/>
<br/>
Right now we are busy working on upgrading our game engine and doing some optimizations!<br/>
But we won’t let that stop us from giving you some fun new things to be creative with. <br/>
It’s been a while since we added some new blocks and parts, we decided to add a few new ones that we made for Survival mode recently. We think that you might enjoy these! But that’s not all! We also added a dance category to each Totebot Head with new sounds! All you scrap musicians can now make some seriously catchy dance tracks!<br/>
<br/>
Here is the full list:<br/>
<br/>
* Added Light Path Block<br/>
* Added a Pillow<br/>
* Added Small Pipe set<br/>
* Added Support Pillar and Support Pillar Stand.<br/>
* Added new dance category and sounds to all Totebot Heads.<br/>
* Fixed a bug with the Weld Tool that made it possible to weld rotated objects into each other.<br/><br/>
