Hey Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
A new update is here.<br/>
This time, we have a big sound update for you. <br/>
Since release, we felt that the sounds were not as responsive and satisfying <br/>
as we wanted them to be. So we decided to give the sounds some extra love.<br/>
The collisions are more noticeable now and we even added sounds to sliding objects. <br/>
Your creations will sound better now!<br/>
<br/>
We also took the time to fix a bunch of other things.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Major collision audio rework.<br/>
* Shape building is no longer canceled when other players update the same creation.<br/>
* Players can now switch between multiplayer and single player without restarting the game.<br/>
* Weld tool performance and interaction fixes.<br/>
* Q and Escape can now close Paint tool GUI.<br/>
* Various Connect tool fixes.<br/>
* Stability fixes.<br/>
* Various other bugfixes.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that small updates like this <br/>
do not affect the work we do on optimization, bigger requested features and survival mode. <br/>
