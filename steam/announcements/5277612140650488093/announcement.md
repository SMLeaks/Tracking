**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
We are back!<br/>
This time with a test for our upcoming update.<br/>
We’ve been focusing most of our time on survival lately but we finally got some time to add a few requested features and improvements. Thanks to our amazing community for always letting us know what you want to see in Scrap Mechanic. <br/>
<br/>
This time we added a new feature to the sensor. The sensor can now be set to a color mode to detect colors from the Paint Tool. <br/>
We got a lot of mechanics asking us for this feature. Mechanics can now build cars that follow painted lines on the ground and other awesome things. On top of that, we also made the sensor much more accurate when detecting things. <br/>
<br/>
Another very requested feature is a search bar in the inventory.<br/>
Very useful if you have a lot of mods installed. It’s now also added to the test.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we also did some fps improvements when the player is walking on a big creation. Before the whole creation was collision detecting against the player but now it’s only the closest area the player is walking on that gets detected. This is a huge improvement from before and will really allow mechanics to make larger creations without having to cut them up in sections for better fps. We are really happy with this one.<br/>
<br/>
The final version of this update will also come with a few new building parts. They are not included in this test. <br/>
<br/>
We would love to hear how you find these new improvements. <br/>
