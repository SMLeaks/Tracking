**Hi Mechanics!**


Good news! Challenge Mode is finally back!
For all new Mechanics - Challenge mode puts your creativity to the test in the Master Mechanic Trials, a fun set of challenges all mechanics must take before they’re officially dispatched to the farming planet to perform maintenance on those pesky Farmbots. 
Challenge mode is also a great way to learn the basics of building in Scrap Mechanic!

Here's the Challange Mode trailer:
