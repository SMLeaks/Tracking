**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
Good news! Challenge Mode is finally back!<br/>
For all new Mechanics - Challenge mode puts your creativity to the test in the Master Mechanic Trials, a fun set of challenges all mechanics must take before they’re officially dispatched to the farming planet to perform maintenance on those pesky Farmbots. <br/>
Challenge mode is also a great way to learn the basics of building in Scrap Mechanic!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the Challange Mode trailer: <br/>
