**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
Steam Workshop is now finally in Scrap Mechanic!<br/>
<br/>
We would like to thank all the mechanics who helped us test the Scrap Mechanic Workshop beta. Thanks for all the feedback!<br/>
<br/>
Now we really look forward to see your awesome creations in the [Scrap Mechanic Workshop!](http://steamcommunity.com/app/387990/workshop/)<br/>
There are already a ton of creations shared that you should check out.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the new Workshop lift feature works:<br/>
<br/>
* **Save creation** <br/>
To save your creation, make sure itâ€™s on the lift and then press E on the lift to access the menu. <br/>
<br/>
* **Build saved creation**<br/>
To build saved or downloaded creations, you need to have an empty lift and press E on the lift.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Here are the update notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Added Blueprint Import and Export feature with Workshop functionality.<br/>
* Some worlds that were crashing the game when loaded should now work.<br/>
* Fixed a bug with the Weld Tool that could crash the game.<br/><br/>
