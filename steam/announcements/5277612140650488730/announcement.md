It’s time for another bug fix and optimization test.<br/>
We got a lot of awesome feedback from you mechanics so we decided to fix some of the reported issues! <br/>
These bug fix updates are really important for us to do from time to time to make sure the game runs well. Also to make sure the game code stays nice and clean for our upcoming updates. <br/>
