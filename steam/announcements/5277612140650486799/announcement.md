**Hi Mechanics!**<br/>
We are getting closer to the full spud gun update release.<br/>
In this patch, sensors now detect potatoes!<br/>
We also made some further big improvements to the network code. Unfortunately, this delayed the Spudgun Update, but we really wanted to include these improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is new in the updated test:<br/>
<br/>
* Sensors are triggered by potatoes.<br/>
* Reworked network code for creations and all interactive parts.<br/>
* Fixed a bug causing ground particles and sound not to trigger.<br/>
* Mod support for particles and audio.<br/>
* Crash fixes.<br/>
* Old worlds will now work.<br/><br/>
<br/>
**Here is how you access the test!**<br/>
