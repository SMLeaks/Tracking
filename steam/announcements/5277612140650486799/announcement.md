[B]Hi Mechanics![/B]
We are getting closer to the full spud gun update release.
In this patch, sensors now detect potatoes!
We also made some further big improvements to the network code. Unfortunately, this delayed the Spudgun Update, but we really wanted to include these improvements.


This is new in the updated test:

*Sensors are triggered by potatoes.

*Fixed a bug causing ground particles and sound not to trigger.
*Mod support for particles and audio.
*Crash fixes.
*Old worlds will now work.
