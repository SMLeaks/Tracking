If you like to help us test the upcoming glass block<br/>
You can do so now by following these steps.<br/>

Update: We have updated the glass test branch. If the glass was invisible earlier, it should now be visible for you.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that these small updates do not affect the work we do on optimization, bigger requested features or survival mode. <br/>
The welding tool and much more is still in the works.<br/>
