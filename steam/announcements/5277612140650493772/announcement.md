Hi Mechanics!<br/>
We know a few of you have been having problems with broken savefiles and we are still trying to figure out what broke them. But we have a temporary solution in place now.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Multithreaded physics is back.<br/>
* The game tries to repair saves with lost creations or crash on load.<br/>
* Load game list is scrollable.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Also, not related to this patch but important to know! <br/>
In a recent update to the Steam Beta Client there is an issue with Steam Overlay in Scrap Mechanic, causing low fps. <br/>
If you experience low fps, plz check the troubleshooting thread on the forums. <br/>
