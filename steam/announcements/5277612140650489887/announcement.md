<br/>
It’s finally time for a new test!<br/>
This time it’s our official mod tool. This first update will make it a lot easier for modders to create new parts and blocks and share them trough workshop. Making it possible to reach a lot more mechanics. We plan to keep adding new features to the mod tool as we keep work with survival mode, making more things possible.<br/>
<br/>
We have added a simple guide on how to get started. <br/>
You can check it out here [Mod Guide](http://scrapmechanic.gamepedia.com/Modding)<br/>
<br/>
Also, our artists have prepared two fun mods for all you mechanics to start playing with.<br/>
Check them out here:<br/>

[Button and Switches Pack](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873609632&searchtext=)<br/>
<br/>
If you like to play with these new mods and help us test things out, you can do so now by following these steps:<br/>

<br/>
We’ve also published a set of guidelines to help mechanics understand how to make the most of the new tool, along with some changes to our terms and conditions, including to explain:<br/>
<br/>
* Who can use the tools and mods<br/>
* Who owns mods and how to respect the work of others<br/>
* Some important rules and things to avoid when modding<br/>
* Some guidance on how to make the most out of your mods<br/><br/>
We think these changes and guidelines are important to make sure the Scrap Mechanic modding community continues to be an open, friendly and fun place, which encourages creativity, sharing and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Before you get started make sure to:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We’ve integrated Scrap Mechanic with Steam Workshop to make it easy for you to find and share mods.<br/>
