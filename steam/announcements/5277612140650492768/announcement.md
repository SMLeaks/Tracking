Hi Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
We have a nice little update for you today. <br/>
Itâ€™s finally time for you to get your hands on the shiny glass block.<br/>
It was highly requested by many of you.<br/>
We added a building block and a few new windows for you to build with.<br/>
More windows to come in future updates.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the patch notes:<br/>
<br/>
* Added a new glass block<br/>
* Added new window parts<br/>
* Updated Totebot Head: Blip, Bass and Synth Voice so they can play long notes.<br/>
* Added a volume slider to the Totebot Heads.<br/>
* Fixed near clip plane issues. <br/><br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that small updates like this<br/>
do not affect the work we do on optimization, bigger requested features and survival mode. <br/>
The welding tool and much more is still in the works.<br/>
<br/>
We at Scrap Mechanic HQ wish you a creative weekend!<br/>
