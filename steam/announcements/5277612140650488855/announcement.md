Hi Mechanics!<br/>
<br/>
The Piston is finally here!<br/>
We finally managed to free up some time from survival to finish up the Piston.<br/>
We would like to give a big thanks to everyone who helped us do some testing. The creations we already seen made with the piston have been really impressive!<br/>
<br/>
What makes the Scrap Mechanic Piston so special, is that not only can it be activated with a trigger. But it can also be connected to a controller to extend and contract in a sequence! This opens up a ton of new creative possibilities! <br/>
<br/>
Check out our new Piston trailer!<br/>

<br/>
<1>Two things to keep in mind before using the piston!</1><br/>
<br/>
* Right now, the piston will not extend if there is no object on the piston. <br/>
So please remember that when building. This will also get fixed.<br/>
<br/>
* The piston does not have any collision at the moment. <br/>
Only what sits on the piston will have collision.<br/>
This is something we will change later. But itâ€™s a complicated task and needs more work.<br/>
So please keep in mind that if you take advantage of this in your creations, then they might stop working when we finally add the collision later on.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Hope you will have fun playing with the piston!<br/>
<br/>
Time for us to go back and work on survival mode.<br/>
We will share more survival goodness in the next devblog!<br/>
<br/>
<1>UPDATED:</1><br/>
(July 4)<br/>
* Fixed a issue with dynamic lighting that was affected by the latest NVIDIA driver update.<br/>
* Optimized the lift visualization to make it faster when pointing with the lift on creations.<br/>
* Fixed a bug with merging static creations. Causing parts to be in the wrong place.<br/>
* Changed back to the orgininal more stronger suspension (Jul 6)<br/><br/>
<br/>
(June 29)<br/>
We had a bug in this update previously that is now fixed. <br/>
It might have stopped some old worlds from opening for a small number of players<br/>
who started the game just when the update came up. If you are experiencing this issue,<br/>
you can recover it by following these steps.<br/>
Open a directory browser or press Windows Button + R and type <br/>
%appdata%\Axolot Games\Scrap Mechanic\User<br/>
then go to User_{steamid}/Save/Backup/ and copy the savefile with todays date back to the User_{steamid}/Save/ directory.<br/>
 Sorry for the inconvenience.<br/>
