**Calling all Mechanics!**<br/>
<br/>
After a long time in development, Survival mode is finally here! <br/>
At long last, it’s time for us to deliver all the new content that we’ve been working on, in our biggest update ever! It’s so big, it feels like we just released an entire survival game, but this is just the beginning: we will be adding a whole lot more content to this mode in the future, so stay tuned!<br/>
<br/>
**What’s in Survival Mode?**<br/>
Survival mode introduces a whole new mode to Scrap Mechanic!<br/>
Here’s the deal: you’re a robot maintenance mechanic on a mission to a fully-automated farm planet. By sheer luck, you survive your spaceship crashing just before touchdown, but things are about to get worse! The Farmbots, originally programmed to harvest the land and send the produce to nearby planets, have gone haywire and are out to stomp you flat! Stranded on a planet full of rampaging robots, you and your friends have to use your wits, your imagination and wily knack of turning your surroundings to your advantage to stay alive!<br/>

Keep an eye out for more exciting developments in Survival Mode!<br/>
We’ll be keeping Scrap mechanic in Early Access for a while longer, as we add newer, better content to Survival mode.<br/>
Scrap mechanic is still a work in progress: there are a ton of things we want to fix, tweak and add, before the game is in perfect condition for a final release.<br/>
<br/>
**Here are the things that we will be focusing on for this month:**<br/>
1. Fixing bugs! This is our first and foremost priority.<br/>
2. Applying a little bit of tweak and polish to Challenge mode. We’ll be re-enabling the mode very soon.<br/>
3. Optimizing the existing UI, to help our players make the most out of their Scrap Mechanic experience.<br/>
4. Update some languages that are missing some translation.<br/>
5. Adding content to Survival mode, applying fixes and expanding the content on the rest of the game.<br/>
<br/>
It’s been a long wait and we owe this project’s successful completion and release to each and every one of you. Your support and patience have helped us get through this monumental development effort.<br/>
<br/>
From all of us at Axolot, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts <br/>
Now let’s play some Survival!<br/>
