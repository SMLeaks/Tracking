**Hi Mechanics**<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping us test the latest fixes. <br/>
We got some great feedback!<br/>
The fixes are now added to the main branch. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the full list:<br/>
<br/>
* Other players now have names above their head in multiplayer.<br/>
* Fixed a bug where the player could not remove connections from a seat with 10 connections.<br/>
* The lift will no longer push the player off when raised.<br/>
* Fixed a Weld Tool bug.<br/>
* Added smooth camera zooming.<br/>
* New Sledgehammer cursor appears when within range of something you can hit.<br/>
* Added preview for tools in the inventory.<br/>
* Added text messages for the Radio; "This Radio is connected to a Button/Switch/Sensor".<br/><br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that small updates like this do not affect the work we do on optimization, bigger requested features and survival mode.<br/>
<br/>
We are aware of crash issues conserning AMD Radeon 300-series graphics. We are working on a solution! In the meantime try disabling AMD Gaming Evolved Overlay (Raptr) recording software. This has helped some players get the game running.<br/>
