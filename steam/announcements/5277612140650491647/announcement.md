**Hi Mechanics**


Thanks for helping us test the latest fixes. 
We got some great feedback!
The fixes are now added to the main branch. 

Here is the full list:
[list]
*Other players now have names above their head in multiplayer.
*Fixed a bug where the player could not remove connections from a seat with 10 connections.
*The lift will no longer push the player off when raised.
*Fixed a Weld Tool bug.
*Added smooth camera zooming.
*New Sledgehammer cursor appears when within range of something you can hit.
*Added preview for tools in the inventory.
*Added text messages for the Radio; "This Radio is connected to a Button/Switch/Sensor".

Keep in mind that small updates like this do not affect the work we do on optimization, bigger requested features and survival mode.

We are aware of crash issues conserning AMD Radeon 300-series graphics. We are working on a solution! In the meantime try disabling AMD Gaming Evolved Overlay (Raptr) recording software. This has helped some players get the game running.
